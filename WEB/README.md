# Sprintorio Marketing Site (WEB)

Static marketing/landing site for [Sprintorio](https://github.com/metaforismo/sprintorio), built with SvelteKit and the static adapter.

## Canonical origin

Set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to the URL where you host this website before building. The local default is `http://localhost:4173`; pages use noindex until a site URL is configured. No public hosted service or demo is advertised.

## Stack

- **SvelteKit** (prerendered static, `@sveltejs/adapter-static`)
- **Svelte 5** (runes mode)
- **Tailwind CSS v4**
- **shadcn-svelte** primitives (button, badge)
- **Lucide** icons

## SEO conventions

- **Centralized config**: `src/lib/config/site.ts` — canonical origin, defaults, `url()` helper.
- **Reusable SEO component**: `src/lib/components/Seo.svelte` — title, description, canonical, robots, full OG/Twitter metadata, JSON-LD.
- **JSON-LD**: Organization, WebSite, SoftwareApplication on homepage; BreadcrumbList + WebPage on all child pages.
- **Sitemap**: Generated at build time via `src/routes/sitemap.xml/+server.ts` using the route registry.
- **robots.txt**: Declares the sitemap location.
- **Image optimization**: All `<img>` tags carry intrinsic `width`/`height` and descriptive `alt`.

## Content conventions

- **Route registry**: `src/lib/data/routes.ts` — source of truth for sitemap entries, hubs, breadcrumbs, and shared metadata.
- **Content registries**: `src/lib/data/features.ts`, `self-hosting.ts`, `compare.ts`, `alternatives.ts` — data-driven content for dynamic routes.
- **Release version**: `src/lib/release.svelte.ts` — `useLatestRelease()` fetches the `UI/static/releases.json` manifest from the repository's main branch at runtime (same mechanism as the app). Static HTML renders `Unreleased` until the repository publishes a release manifest.
- **Silo architecture**: Each hub (Features, Self-Hosting, Compare, Alternatives) has a hub page + child detail pages using shared `PageLayout.svelte`.
- **Standalone pages**: `/open-source`, `/license`, `/security`, `/about`, `/roadmap` — each uses `StandalonePage.svelte` wrapper.
- **Breadcrumbs**: Every page includes a `<Breadcrumbs>` component with structured data.
- **CTA**: Every content page ends with a `<CtaSection>`.
- **Comparisons**: Neutral language, visible last-reviewed date (July 11, 2026), methodology notes.
- **Self-hosting pages**: Aligned with the actual README and `selfhosting/` configs. No secrets exposed.

## Build output

All routes prerendered to static HTML in `build/`. The `strict: true` adapter option ensures missing pages fail the build.

## SEO validation

The script at `scripts/validate-seo.mjs` checks:

1. Every route produces an HTML file
2. `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, `<link rel="canonical">` on every page
3. `<h1>` on every page
4. All indexable routes appear in `sitemap.xml`
5. JSON-LD blocks are valid JSON
6. Images have `alt` and intrinsic `width`/`height`
7. Internal links resolve to existing files
8. Bare fragment links (`#...`) on non-homepages are flagged

The homepage uses actual Sprintorio Delivery captures: `static/product-screenshot.png` and `static/product-screenshot-1440.png` are 1440 × 1600; `static/product-screenshot-720.png` is a separate 720 × 1600 capture selected below 640 px through a picture source. The preview crops from the top at a maximum height of 520 px. Social metadata uses the dedicated 1200 × 630 `static/social-card.png` artwork.

## Product boundary

Sprintorio is an unreleased source build with project briefs, milestones and manually recorded test evidence. Readiness summarizes saved results; it does not run tests or approve deployment. GitHub release metadata is loaded only from the Sprintorio repository; without a published release, the site displays Unreleased and links to source.

The responsive suite uses Playwright Chromium by default. To use an already installed Google Chrome without downloading browser binaries, run `PLAYWRIGHT_CHANNEL=chrome npm run test:responsive`.
