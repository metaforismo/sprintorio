		intro:
			'“Open source issue tracker” describes several different products: focused trackers, project-management suites and issue systems attached to source hosting. License and edition model matter as much as the feature list.',
		sections: [
			{
				heading: 'The landscape',
				body: 'Start by deciding whether issues are the product’s center or one module in a larger suite.',
				list: [
					'Focused and agile tools: Sprintorio, Plane, and Taiga — issue workflows and sprint or cycle planning',
					'All-in-one PM: Redmine, OpenProject, Leantime — broader scope with Gantt, wikis, time tracking',
					'Platform-embedded: GitLab Issues, Gitea, Gogs — tracking alongside source code hosting'
				]
			},
			{
				heading: 'Licensing differences',
				body: 'Source availability does not make licenses interchangeable. Permissive licenses and copyleft licenses impose different redistribution obligations, while some vendors maintain paid editions or features alongside a public repository.',
				list: [
					'Apache 2.0: Sprintorio — permits commercial use and modification subject to license conditions',
					'Copyleft projects use licenses such as AGPL or GPL; review each project’s current license and obligations',
					'Open core: some tools offer basic features as open source with paid enterprise add-ons'
				]
			},
			{
				heading: 'Where Sprintorio fits',
				body: 'Sprintorio is a focused, self-hosted issue tracker rather than a general project-management suite. Its current application and deployment code live in one Apache 2.0 repository, with no enterprise edition or license-key path.',

					'Keyboard shortcuts and issue search',
					'Cycles, projects and GitHub automation',

		sections: [
