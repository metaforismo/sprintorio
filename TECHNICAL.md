# Sprintorio Dev Machines Technical Specification

Production architecture and implementation contract for isolated, multi-container development environments and agentic coding runs.

## Status

The repository includes the Dev Machines control plane, PostgreSQL schema, lifecycle manager, authenticated gateway, provider adapters, runtime images, activity collector, self-hosted Compose profiles, and product UI. The subsystem is disabled by default and must be configured explicitly by a self-hosted operator.

Dev Machines target trusted self-hosted workspaces. Docker hardening reduces risk, but ordinary containers are not a sufficient isolation boundary for mutually hostile tenants. Operators requiring hostile multi-tenant execution must replace the runtime interface with VM or microVM isolation.

## Principles

- A Dev Machine is a logical workspace composed of cooperating containers. It is never a monolithic IDE/browser/agent container.
- Generic machine creation does not require repository, branch, issue, project, or manual TTL input. Friendly random names are case-insensitively unique per creator within a workspace and can be checked through the availability API.
- Repository and environment defaults resolve from issue, then project, then team, then workspace. One machine has affinity to one repository and can host multiple issue worktrees from that repository; use a separate machine for another repository/environment or concurrent conflicting workload.
- The Sprintorio API does not receive the Docker socket.
- Agent, developer, browser, collector, egress, and gateway containers do not receive the Docker socket.
- The Machine Manager is the only Dev Machines runtime component with Docker socket access and is treated as host-privileged. The separately optional system updater also mounts the socket when enabled.
- Machine services never publish host ports. Caddy and the Machine Gateway are the only public ingress path.
- Every machine has an isolated internal Docker network and a dedicated workspace volume.
- code-server and ttyd run in the same developer container with a shared filesystem, processes, `HOME`, tools, and tmux.
- Human browser sessions, machine tokens, and GitHub credentials are distinct credentials with different scopes and lifetimes.
- Top-level browser launches and native terminal WebSockets use distinct one-time ticket flows.
- PostgreSQL is the durable source of truth. Runtime operations are leased, retried, idempotent, and reconcilable after process restarts.
- Agent providers produce a common Sprintorio result model regardless of CLI implementation.

## Machine Topology

```text
Dev Machine
├── developer           optional code-server:8080, ttyd:7681, tmux, Git checkouts
├── agent-*             on-demand container per Claude Code/OpenCode/Codex/custom run
├── browser             optional Chrome, CDP, KasmVNC
├── collector           activity and heartbeat collection
├── egress              outbound HTTP/HTTPS policy proxy
├── private network     Docker bridge with internal=true
└── workspace volume    repository worktrees and generated artifacts
```

Every created container has a deterministic name and labels containing `workspace_id`, `machine_id`, and `routing_key`. Runtime discovery never depends on a publicly exposed port. Collector and egress services are always represented; developer/terminal and browser services depend on machine configuration, and agent services are created for individual runs.

The shared workspace is writable by developer and agent containers. The collector receives it read-only. Browser and egress containers do not receive the workspace mount. Per-container home, `/tmp`, `/run`, and secret paths use tmpfs scratch mounts.

The developer service is represented by separate `ide` and `terminal` service records but both point at one container: code-server listens on `8080`, ttyd listens on `7681`, and terminal sessions attach to named tmux sessions under the same `HOME`, process tree, tools, and `/workspace` used by code-server.

Agent containers are created on demand. Multiple runs are represented separately, although workspaces should default to one mutating autonomous agent at a time to avoid conflicting writes.

## Network Isolation

The manager creates `sprintorio-machine-{routing-key}` with Docker's `Internal` option. Only that machine's services and the trusted Machine Gateway join it.

No machine workload joins the PostgreSQL, Redis, API, or Compose control network. The egress container is the only machine service also attached to the shared external `sprintorio-machine-egress` network.

Chrome's debugging endpoint binds only to browser-container loopback. Browser-enabled machines receive a dedicated encrypted credential scoped to the browser and collector services; an authenticated relay exposes only the read-only target-list endpoint needed for navigation telemetry and does not proxy CDP control or WebSocket endpoints.

Workloads receive `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` pointing to their machine's egress container. The proxy:

- rejects IP-literal destinations;
- resolves hostnames itself and rejects private, loopback, link-local, multicast, and unspecified addresses;
- permits ordinary HTTP on port 80 and HTTPS on port 443, while allowing CONNECT tunnels only to port 443;
- applies optional suffix-based domain allow and deny lists;
- resolves and dials the validated public address to reduce DNS-rebinding exposure.

An empty domain allowlist permits public Internet destinations while still blocking private address ranges. Operators can fail closed by configuring an explicit allowlist.
An explicit allowlist must include the Sprintorio ingestion host plus every Git and provider API hostname required by configured agents.

## Dynamic Routing

The selected ingress design is a hybrid Caddy and Go gateway:

```text
Browser request
  -> wildcard DNS
  -> Caddy wildcard TLS
  -> Machine Gateway
  -> host/service lookup in PostgreSQL
  -> current authorization and machine-state check
  -> private container address
```

Required host patterns are:

| Host | Service |
|---|---|
| `{routing-key}.{DEV_MACHINE_DOMAIN}` | IDE |
| `{routing-key}-terminal.{DEV_MACHINE_DOMAIN}` | Native terminal WebSocket |
| `{routing-key}-browser.{DEV_MACHINE_DOMAIN}` | Browser/KasmVNC |

Routing keys are random lowercase hexadecimal strings. The gateway performs an exact configured-domain suffix check and rejects suffix-confusion hosts.

Caddy has one fixed wildcard route. Per-machine Caddy configuration is unnecessary. Teardown removes the database route and private network, so stale hosts return not found without a proxy reload.

The gateway uses Go's reverse proxy with WebSocket upgrades, streaming flushes, unlimited response write duration, bounded dial timeouts, and long-lived connection support. Caddy terminates wildcard TLS and forwards all wildcard machine hosts, including WebSocket upgrades, to the gateway; per-machine Caddy rewrites are not used.

## Authenticated Machine Access

Main Sprintorio cookies remain host-only. They are never broadened to the machine domain.

### Browser-cookie launch path

This path is used for top-level code-server and browser launches.

1. An authenticated user calls the service launch endpoint from the Sprintorio UI.
2. The API checks workspace membership, Dev Machine permission, machine state, and service eligibility.
3. The API creates a random one-time ticket. Only its SHA-256 hash is stored.
4. The ticket is bound to user, workspace, machine, service, exact host, and a short expiry (default 60 seconds, configurable via `DEV_MACHINE_ACCESS_TICKET_TTL_SECONDS`).
5. The browser follows the returned HTTPS URL.
6. The gateway atomically consumes the ticket and redirects to remove it from the URL.
7. The gateway creates a revocable machine session and sets a host-only `__Host-sprintorio-machine` cookie with `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, `Path=/`, and `SameSite=Lax`. Lax permits the initial cross-site top-level launch while the separate registrable domain provides the site boundary.
8. Every proxied request rechecks session expiry, workspace membership, permitted role, machine state, service identity, and exact host.
9. Stop or teardown revokes all tickets and sessions.

Browser-cookie routes strip `Cookie`, `Authorization`, `Proxy-Authorization`, and all incoming `X-Sprintorio-*` headers before forwarding. Upstream host-only application cookies are permitted, but parent-domain cookies and the reserved machine-session cookie are dropped. State-changing requests and browser-cookie service WebSocket upgrades require an exact scheme-and-host machine `Origin`; sibling machines cannot submit authenticated requests to each other.

### Native terminal ticket path

The Sprintorio UI renders `@xterm/xterm` and speaks ttyd's native WebSocket protocol (`ttyd.v1`). It does not expose ttyd's web page and does not use the machine session cookie for terminal attachment.

1. An authenticated user creates a terminal session with `POST /dev-machines/:machineId/terminal-sessions`, optionally bound to a checkout.
2. The API validates machine state, checkout readiness, and configured `FRONTEND_URL`, then creates a runtime tmux session name and working directory.
3. The API creates a one-use ticket whose stored hash is bound to the raw ticket, exact normalized `FRONTEND_URL` origin, exact terminal host, user, service, tmux session name, working directory, and expiry.
4. The UI opens the returned `wss://{routing-key}-terminal.{DEV_MACHINE_DOMAIN}/ws?...` URL from the main frontend origin.
5. The gateway requires the WebSocket `Origin` to equal the configured `FRONTEND_URL` origin exactly, consumes the ticket atomically, rewrites upstream to ttyd `/ws` with only the internal `arg=session` and `arg=cwd` values, strips credentials before proxying, audits the exchange, and touches machine activity until the socket closes.

Opening a paused machine service queues an idempotent resume operation and returns a `resuming` response with `retry_after_seconds`; the UI polls/retries. Queued or spawning machines return `pending`. Stopped, destroyed, expired, and invalid states do not auto-resume.

Machine access decisions are persisted in `dev_machine_access_logs` without query strings.

## Machine and Collector Tokens

Collectors use random machine tokens rather than user sessions. Token hashes, scopes, expiry, revocation, and last-use timestamps are stored in `dev_machine_tokens`.

Initial collector scopes are:

- `events:write`
- `logs:write`

Heartbeat is submitted through the event-ingestion endpoint. The raw token is encrypted as a collector-only secret and delivered through tmpfs. Event and log ingestion endpoints reject expired, revoked, incorrectly scoped, or destroyed-machine tokens.

## Provider Abstraction

Providers are implemented in `BE/internal/agent` and registered at startup.

```go
type Provider interface {
    Metadata() Metadata
    BuildInvocation(RunInput) (Invocation, error)
    ParseEvents([]byte) []Event
    ParseResult(stdout, stderr string, exitCode int) RunResult
}
```

`Invocation` contains an image, argv array, working directory, declared secret names, and interactive flag. Providers do not return shell strings. Generic custom providers reject shell entrypoints and require a pinned image tag or digest.

Initial providers:

| ID | CLI | Secret declaration | Adapter modes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | Claude Code | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | interactive, autonomous |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | model/provider dependent | interactive, autonomous |
| `codex` | Codex | `OPENAI_API_KEY` | interactive, autonomous |
| `custom` | Admin-configured argv CLI | explicit configuration | interactive, autonomous |

Provider adapters can construct both invocation modes, but the current product dialogs queue autonomous runs only and there is no UI/gateway endpoint for attaching to an interactive agent container. The shared developer image pins OpenCode, Claude Code, and Codex CLI versions for direct interactive terminal/code-server use. Custom providers must be enabled by workspace policy and are currently launched through the autonomous dashboard flow. Provider-specific agent images remain separately pinned by tag or digest in configuration and runtime Dockerfiles; custom provider images must also be pinned.

### Normalized Result

```json
{
  "status": "succeeded",
  "summary": "Implemented authenticated machine routing",
  "changed_files": ["BE/internal/machine/gateway.go"],
  "commits": ["abc123"],
  "branch": "sprintorio/spr-50",
  "pull_request_url": "https://github.com/example/repo/pull/42",
  "tests_run": ["go test ./..."],
  "test_status": "passed",
  "risk_notes": [],
  "artifacts": []
}
```

Completed autonomous provider stdout/stderr is collected and redacted before persistence. JSON-line provider events are normalized into `dev_machine_events`.

## Execution Modes

### Human and Agent

The user opens authenticated IDE and browser links from Sprintorio and attaches native terminal tabs rendered by the main UI. Terminal tabs speak `ttyd.v1` over the dedicated terminal host and attach to tmux sessions inside the developer container. The built-in Claude Code, OpenCode, and Codex CLIs can be used directly from that terminal. Agent runs started from the machine dashboard use separate containers and run autonomously to completion under a timeout.

### Agent Only

An autonomous run receives:

- optional issue/project and checkout linkage;
- repository, base branch, working branch, and workspace path from the selected checkout or machine repository affinity;
- prompt and acceptance criteria;
- allowed commands and forbidden paths;
- exact test-command argv;
- maximum runtime;
- explicitly allowed secret names;
- push and pull-request policy.

Sprintorio adds an execution contract instructing the provider to work only inside the selected workspace path, avoid credential output, run the requested tests, commit results, and use the configured working branch.

## Lifecycle

Machine status and desired status are persisted separately.

```text
queued -> spawning -> running
                       -> paused -> running
                       -> stopping -> stopped -> running
                       -> expired -> tearing_down -> destroyed
spawn/reconcile failure -> failed -> spawning or tearing_down
```

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `configuring` | Reserved status; current creation writes `queued` directly |
| `queued` | A spawn/start operation is waiting for a manager lease |
| `spawning` | Network, volume, images, and service containers are being created |
| `running` | Services are started and gateway access is permitted |
| `paused` | Docker processes are paused; memory remains allocated |
| `stopping` | Services are being stopped |
| `stopped` | Containers are retained but CPU/RAM are released; start is allowed |
| `tearing_down` | Sessions and Docker resources are being removed |
| `destroyed` | Final lifecycle state after runtime teardown; retained events/results remain queryable |
| `failed` | A lifecycle operation attempt failed and requires retry or teardown |
| `expired` | Maximum runtime elapsed and teardown has been queued |

Lifecycle commands write `dev_machine_operations` with generation and idempotency key. Leasing locks the machine row and selects at most one ordinary operation per machine; teardown and cancellation may preempt a long-running agent operation. The manager cancels local run contexts before destructive cleanup. Every non-destructive state write is conditional on the operation generation, and a stale spawn compensates by tearing down anything it created, so it cannot overwrite or survive a newer desired state. Identical idempotency-key retries return the original operation; reusing a key for another action is rejected.

Every reconciliation pass inspects Docker networks, volumes, gateway attachment, and non-agent service containers. A desired-running machine with missing, stopped, or detached resources is repaired from deterministic names and labels before the database is returned to `running`. Workspace deletion is rejected until all machine runtimes are destroyed, preserving the records needed for cleanup.

Resource names and labels are deterministic. Missing resources during teardown count as success. A partial spawn removes containers, disconnects the gateway, and removes the private network and workspace volume before retrying.

The production repository currently supplies services to the runtime in egress, collector, developer, then browser order; the Docker runtime starts them in caller-provided order rather than computing dependencies itself. Developer and browser containers publish file-based Docker health checks.

Idle pause and hard runtime are separate controls. Workspace policy defaults idle pause to 240 minutes; `keep_running=true` bypasses idle pause for that machine. Gateway requests, native terminal WebSockets, API activity touches, checkouts, and agent runs update `last_activity_at`. The manager queues idempotent pause operations for idle running machines, but it does not automatically delete machines. Maximum hard runtime is policy-controlled through `expires_at`; expired machines transition to `expired` and teardown is queued.

Pause, stop, teardown, and permanent delete are intentionally distinct:

- **Pause** pauses Docker processes and keeps memory allocated.
- **Stop** stops containers while retaining deterministic runtime resources for a later start.
- **Teardown** revokes sessions/tickets and removes containers, the private network, and workspace volume; database history remains.
- **Permanent delete** is admin-only. `DELETE /dev-machines/:machineId` and selected bulk DELETE record `delete_requested_at`; the manager converges runtime teardown first and purges after the operation completes. The `/permanent-delete` endpoint remains an equivalent explicit route, while bulk permanent delete is a guarded purge for old already-safe rows only.

## Resource Limits and Quotas

Machine sizes are aggregate admission profiles:

| Size | CPU | RAM | Workspace disk hard quota | Maximum runtime |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| small | 2 vCPU | 4 GB | 20 GB | 2 hours |
| medium | 4 vCPU | 8 GB | 50 GB | 4 hours |
| large | 8 vCPU | 16 GB | 100 GB | 8 hours |

The manager assigns a bounded percentage of the profile to each service and applies Docker `NanoCPUs`, memory, memory-swap, and PID limits. Non-builder workloads use a read-only root filesystem, tmpfs scratch paths, `CapDrop=ALL`, `no-new-privileges`, the Docker default seccomp profile or a configured replacement, and AppArmor where available. Environment Builder deliberately relaxes the developer container root filesystem so owners/admins can install tooling before snapshot. Docker's `json-file` logs rotate at 10 MiB with three files per container, and removal paths also remove anonymous image volumes.

Workspace policy controls:

- maximum concurrent machines;
- maximum machines per user;
- maximum daily agent runs;
- maximum runtime;
- idle pause interval (default 240 minutes; bypassed by per-machine `keep_running`);
- maximum per-machine workspace-volume size;
- allowed providers;
- allowed repositories;
- whether custom providers are allowed.

### Disk Limitation

Workspace volumes use Docker's built-in `local` driver with its `size` option set to the machine profile's exact byte limit. Docker enforces that option through XFS project quotas. The Docker data root must therefore reside on XFS mounted with `pquota` or `prjquota`, and the daemon must not run in a user namespace. The manager creates and removes a quota-probe volume during startup; if Docker reports that quota support is unavailable, manager startup fails and its readiness endpoint remains unavailable. Existing volumes without the expected local driver, ownership labels, and exact hard limit are rejected before containers start or runtime reconciliation reuses them.

The manager still samples workspace usage, stores resource telemetry, and queues a stop at the threshold as defense in depth. That delayed monitor is not the primary storage boundary. CPU, memory, process, and workspace disk limits are enforced by the runtime.

## Secrets

`DEV_MACHINE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is independent from `JWT_SECRET` and is required when Dev Machines are enabled. AES-256-GCM ciphertext and key version are stored in `dev_machine_env_vars`.

Secret flow:

1. The API validates the target service and provider, encrypts the value, and stores only ciphertext.
2. The manager decrypts only active secrets matching the service or agent run.
3. Agent runs receive only names explicitly selected in `allowed_secrets`; required provider names must also resolve to active, unexpired, non-revoked stored secrets before a run is queued.
4. The manager creates a tmpfs at `/run/sprintorio-secrets` and copies files after container start, so secret values do not appear in Docker container configuration.
5. A small entrypoint loads values only into the target child process and removes the files.
6. Browser and egress containers receive no workspace secrets.
7. Manager-captured provider logs are redacted with the exact injected values. IDE command telemetry redacts common key/token/secret/password patterns.

Reserved `SPRINTORIO_*` variables and `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot be supplied by users.

## Scoped Settings, Worktrees, and Environments

Development defaults are stored in `dev_machine_scope_settings`. A setting may provide a linked GitHub repository, base branch, and/or development environment for a workspace, team, project, or issue. Repository and environment values are resolved independently in this order: issue, project, team, workspace. This lets an issue override only the repository while inheriting an environment, or vice versa.

Machine creation accepts optional issue/project/repository information but does not require it. If no repository resolves, legacy repository fields remain empty and the machine starts as a generic developer workspace. When an issue is opened, `POST /dev-machines/:machineId/checkouts` resolves the issue's development settings, enforces the machine's repository affinity, and creates an idempotent issue worktree under `/workspace/tasks/{issue-key}`. A machine can hold multiple ready checkouts from the same repository; checkouts from another repository or environment require a separate machine.

Development Environments are immutable local OCI images created from owner/admin-created Environment Builder machines. Environment Builders run the developer container with a writable root filesystem so tooling can be installed intentionally. Snapshot requests are accepted only while the builder is `paused` or `stopped`; the environment moves `pending -> building -> ready` or `failed`. The snapshot commits the developer container layer with Sprintorio environment/workspace labels, may leave a human-readable local tag (`sprintorio/dev-environment-{id}:snapshot`), and records the immutable local image ID (`sha256:...`) as both `image_ref` and `image_digest` once ready. Machine creation uses only that immutable local ID, verifies the image labels match the expected workspace/environment, and never registry-pulls a missing local snapshot ID. The repository workspace named volume, `/run/sprintorio-secrets`, `/tmp`, and other tmpfs scratch mounts are not part of the image. Selected shell and code-server customization is copied into an image template before commit; files in that template whose names contain `history`, `token`, or `credential` are removed. The complete writable developer layer is still committed, so operators must scrub any other sensitive data before snapshotting.

Environment deletion is two-phase. The API marks an environment `delete_requested`; the manager removes only the immutable local image ID after verifying the Sprintorio environment/workspace labels and only then deletes the database record. Operators migrating hosts must move any required local OCI images separately from PostgreSQL and Docker volumes.

## GitHub Integration

Dev Machines use GitHub App installation tokens, not broad personal access tokens. Generic machines may start without a repository; issue checkouts resolve the linked repository through issue, project, team, then workspace development settings. Once a machine has repository affinity, additional issue worktrees must use the same linked repository.

Required GitHub App repository permissions:

| Permission | Level |
|---|---|
| metadata | read |
| contents | read and write |
| pull requests | read and write |

The manager requests a token restricted to the selected linked repository and required permissions for the machine checkout or agent run. The token is short-lived, never stored in plaintext, and injected only into the developer or agent containers that need Git.

The IDE uses an ephemeral askpass helper for clone. Agent containers install an ephemeral Git credential helper. Sprintorio resolves the workspace or global GitHub App client again and mints a fresh token before creating a pull request after a successful run.

Branches, commits, and pull requests are persisted in `dev_machine_git_refs` with workspace, machine, run, issue, repository, and URL linkage. Existing GitHub webhooks continue to populate the issue development timeline.

Each issue checkout is an idempotent `dev_machine_checkouts` record with its own working branch and workspace path under `/workspace/tasks/{issue-key}`. Agents and terminal sessions can target a checkout; if multiple checkouts exist, agent runs must name the checkout to avoid ambiguous writes.

## Activity and Logs

| Event | Source |
|---|---|
| file created/modified/deleted | collector filesystem scan |
| command finished and exit code | IDE shell hook |
| root-checkout branch changed | Git post-checkout hook |
| root-checkout commit created | Git post-commit hook and collector HEAD scan |
| root-checkout push started | Git pre-push hook |
| browser navigation | collector polling Chrome CDP, query and fragment removed |
| agent provider event | provider JSON-line parser |
| service and resource state | manager lifecycle and Docker sampling |
| machine opened/denied | gateway access audit |
| lifecycle changes | API and manager |

Activity is operational telemetry, not tamper-proof security auditing. Trusted workspace code can bypass in-container hooks.

Structured events use a monotonic `BIGSERIAL` cursor. Completed autonomous agent stdout/stderr uses cursor-addressable `dev_machine_log_chunks`. The schema reserves a PTY stream, but native terminal and interactive-agent PTY output is not currently persisted. Issue worktrees do not install the root-checkout Git hooks. API reads are workspace-scoped. High-volume log retention should be configured and periodically pruned by operators.

The UI exposes machine status, services, resource samples, cursor-paginated events and logs, checkouts, terminal sessions, agent runs, normalized results, commits, branches, PRs, and lifecycle/delete controls. Native terminal attachment is implemented in the Sprintorio UI with `@xterm/xterm`; ttyd's own web page is not exposed.

The migration creates the final scoped-workspace schema directly. Composite foreign keys bind workspace, machine, service, checkout, run, session, and environment tuples so cross-workspace identifiers are rejected by PostgreSQL rather than relying only on application checks. Rolling migration `000033` back is destructive for all Dev Machine control-plane records.

All user-facing repository access is constrained by both `workspace_id` and resource ID. Internal manager lookups are limited to the trusted manager process.

## API

All user APIs are under `/api/workspaces/:slug` and use existing JWT, membership, and RBAC middleware.

```

Lifecycle APIs return `202 Accepted` with an operation record. `/teardown` retains history; admin DELETE and `/permanent-delete` routes record a purge request and return `202 Accepted` while the manager performs the safe hard purge. Selected bulk deletion deduplicates machine IDs and returns per-item `accepted`, `not_found`, `conflict`, or `failed` results. Create returns the queued machine. Service launches and terminal sessions may return `ready`, `pending`, or `resuming` with `retry_after_seconds`. Events and logs use `after_id` cursors.

Example create payload:

```json
{
  "size": "medium",
  "services": { "ide": true, "browser": true },
  "agents": [{ "provider": "opencode", "mode": "autonomous" }],
  "env_vars": [],
  "keep_running": false
}
```

## Failure Handling

| Failure | Behavior |
|---|---|
| API or manager restart | Pending/expired leases remain in PostgreSQL and are re-leased; active operations renew their lease every 30 seconds |
| Image pull or container creation failure | Bounded retry; partial resources removed before retry |
| Docker unavailable | Manager readiness fails; operations remain durable |
| PostgreSQL unavailable | Running containers continue; manager/gateway report degraded health |
| Service unavailable | Gateway returns 502 and records an access/proxy error |
| Hard runtime expiry | Machine becomes `expired`; idempotent teardown is queued; records are not automatically deleted |
| Idle interval reached | A non-keep-running machine receives an idempotent pause operation |
| Opening paused service | API queues an idempotent resume and returns `resuming` with retry guidance |
| Permanent delete | Admin request is persisted; manager queues teardown if needed, then deletes the machine row and child history only after resources are safe |
| Disk threshold reached | Resource event recorded and stop operation queued |
| Teardown repeated | Missing containers/networks/volumes are treated as already removed |
| Agent timeout | Container stopped; run result normalized to `timeout` |
| Agent cancellation | Cancel operation removes the run container |

The manager exposes `/health`, `/ready`, and Prometheus-text `/metrics`. Structured logs include workspace, machine, run, operation/provider where available, event type, and duration. Secret values and full environment maps are not logged.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

Dev Machines are an opt-in Compose profile.

Prerequisites:

- Linux Docker Engine and Compose v2;
- Docker's data root on XFS mounted with project quotas (`pquota` or `prjquota`); rootless or user-namespace Docker is not supported because the local volume driver cannot apply project quotas there;
- `FRONTEND_URL` set to the exact public Sprintorio origin, including scheme and any non-default port, for native terminal WebSocket `Origin` validation;
- a separate registrable domain for machine workloads (e.g. `sprintorio-machines.example.net`), NOT a sibling subdomain of the main application domain;
- wildcard DNS for `*.${DEV_MACHINE_DOMAIN}`;
- production wildcard TLS via a custom Caddy build with a DNS-01 module or an operator-provided wildcard certificate (stock Caddy cannot issue wildcard certs via HTTP-01);
- sufficient host CPU, memory, and disk for configured concurrency;
- a GitHub App with scoped write permissions for autonomous push/PR workflows;
- runtime images built locally or available from a trusted registry.

The checked-in Caddy wildcard block uses `tls internal` (Caddy's local CA), which is suitable for local or internal-network installations. For a public production machine domain, the profile prerequisite inspects the mounted Caddyfile and fails before grants or control-plane startup while an active `tls internal`, `issuer internal`, or `local_certs` directive remains. Replace it with a DNS-01 issuer supported by a custom Caddy build or mount an operator-provided wildcard certificate. `machines.localhost` is the local-development exception.

Build and start:

```sh
docker compose --profile dev-machine-images build
docker compose run --rm backend /app/server migrate up
docker compose --profile dev-machines run --rm machine-gateway-db-provision
docker compose --profile dev-machines up -d
```

Required configuration when enabled:

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `FRONTEND_URL` | Exact public frontend origin; the gateway requires native terminal WebSocket `Origin` to match this value exactly |
| `DEV_MACHINES_ENABLED=true` | Enables API configuration validation and routes |
| `DEV_MACHINE_DOMAIN` | Separate registrable machine base domain, e.g. `sprintorio-machines.example.net` (`machines.localhost` only for local development) |
| `DEV_MACHINE_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | Independent secret-encryption passphrase, at least 32 characters |
| `DEV_MACHINE_INGEST_URL` | Public HTTPS collector ingestion base URL |
| `DEV_MACHINE_GATEWAY_CONTAINER` | Stable gateway container name attached to private networks |
| `DEV_MACHINE_GATEWAY_DB_USER` | Dedicated PostgreSQL login provisioned for the Internet-facing gateway |
| `DEV_MACHINE_GATEWAY_DB_PASSWORD` | Independent gateway database password used by the provisioning job |
| `DEV_MACHINE_GATEWAY_DATABASE_URL` | Optional explicit URL override; required in production outside Compose and must use a different login from `DATABASE_URL` |
| `DEV_MACHINE_SESSION_TTL_MINUTES` | Browser machine-session lifetime |
| `DEV_MACHINE_ACCESS_TICKET_TTL_SECONDS` | One-time launch ticket lifetime |
| `DEV_MACHINE_EGRESS_ALLOWLIST` | Optional comma-separated public domain suffixes |
| `DEV_MACHINE_EGRESS_DENYLIST` | Optional denied domain suffixes |
| `DEV_MACHINE_SECCOMP_PROFILE` | Docker default, unconfined, or an inline JSON profile |
| `DEV_MACHINE_APPARMOR_PROFILE` | Docker default or an operator-loaded host profile name |
| `DEV_MACHINE_DOCKER_HOST` | Docker daemon address (default: unix:///var/run/docker.sock) |
| `DEV_MACHINE_DOCKER_GID` | Numeric host group owner of the mounted Docker socket; obtain it on Linux with `stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock` (Docker Desktop commonly uses `0`) |
| `DEV_MACHINE_*_IMAGE` | Pinned runtime image references; the developer image contains pinned OpenCode/Claude Code/Codex CLIs and provider-specific agent images are pinned separately |

Compose passes the same `DEV_MACHINES_ENABLED` value to the backend, gateway, and manager. The `dev-machines` profile's database-provisioning prerequisite exits before modifying grants or starting the control plane unless that value is exactly `true`; the gateway and manager also retain their own fail-closed startup checks.

The manager image and Compose service run the process as UID/GID 1000 with all Linux capabilities dropped and only the Docker socket's numeric host group added. Docker socket access remains host-root-equivalent despite the non-root UID: it is a host-administrator boundary that must not be reused for general API traffic or exposed to any machine workload.

Compose places the Internet-facing gateway only on an internal `machine-control` network shared with Caddy and PostgreSQL; it does not join the backend/Redis application network or receive the application's database-owner URL. `machine-gateway-db-provision` creates or re-hardens a `NOINHERIT` login after migrations, revokes broad schema/table/sequence/function privileges and role memberships, and grants only route reads, ticket/session transitions, activity timestamp updates, and access-log inserts. The gateway refuses production startup without a separate URL and rejects roles with superuser, role/database creation, replication, row-security bypass, object-creation, or inherited-role powers. Rerun provisioning after schema changes before restarting the gateway; `selfhosting/update.sh` does this automatically while the profile is active.

Valid-looking unknown wildcard hosts are bounded before they can exhaust the database: route lookups use a 60-per-second source limit, a 500-per-second process limit, and a 32-query concurrency cap; missing routes are cached for 30 seconds. Attacker-controlled source and negative-route state is capped, and unknown-route audits are limited to one per source per five minutes and ten total writes per minute. The manager deletes access logs older than 90 days in batches of 1,000. Malformed or out-of-domain hosts are rejected before any database operation.

The self-hosting `dev-machine-images` profile builds the developer, browser, collector, egress, and built-in provider agent images locally. Environment Builder snapshot bytes are additional local OCI images in the host Docker image store, while their references and lifecycle metadata are stored in `dev_machine_environments`; snapshots are not Compose volumes. Backups and host migrations must account for PostgreSQL, Docker named volumes, and any environment images that should survive a host replacement.

`selfhosting/update.sh` detects an active Dev Machines profile without enabling it on other deployments. When active, it rebuilds runtime images before stopping the old gateway and manager, applies migrations with the new backend image, and starts the updated application and control plane only after the schema is current. If migration, role provisioning, or a later update step fails after the stop, its EXIT trap removes the upgrade marker, preserves the original failure status and container logs, and uses `docker compose start` to revive the same previous control-plane containers rather than recreating them from new images.

## Security Limitations

- Docker hardening is not hostile multi-tenant isolation.
- Pinned Chrome Stable packages for amd64 and arm64 run through KasmVNC in a separately hardened non-root container. The browser's internal sandbox is disabled because Docker namespace restrictions conflict with its setup. The browser must not receive provider or GitHub secrets.
- Domain egress controls cannot prevent exfiltration to an explicitly allowed destination.
- Command and filesystem collection is best-effort and can be bypassed by trusted workspace code.
- Provider adapters can construct interactive invocations, but current product dialogs queue autonomous agent runs and no interactive-agent attach endpoint is exposed. Direct interactive use of the built-in CLIs is available through Sprintorio's native xterm terminal; ttyd's web page is not exposed.
- Workspace hard quotas require Docker local-volume project-quota support; the manager intentionally fails startup rather than run machines with an unbounded workspace.
- A dedicated machine subdomain improves cookie isolation, but a separate registrable domain is required for production deployments to prevent cookie scope ambiguity between the main application and machine workloads. Localhost development is exempt because both domains resolve to 127.0.0.1.

These limitations are deployment facts and must not be represented as stronger guarantees in product or security documentation.
